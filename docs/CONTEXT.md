# Installer Context — what the Go pipeline needs to know

Companion to the **Pipeline** doc. Captures what exists today in the three repos, how it maps onto the pipeline phases, and the gaps/decisions to resolve while building the Go installer stage by stage.

Snapshot taken 2026-10-08 from `~/src/{config,nix-secrets,installer}`.

## Decisions so far

- **The Go installer replaces `config/scripts/install-host.sh` entirely**, including the `just install | enroll-sops | deploy-remote` recipes. The bash script is the reference to port from. When the Go installer can do everything the script does, delete the script and those recipes.
- **nix-secrets will be migrated (by Julian) to the pipeline's canonical paths**: `hosts/<host>.yaml` and `host-users/<host>-<user>.yaml`. The problems listed in §3 get fixed as part of that migration. The installer only targets the new layout; it does not need to support `users/<user>.yaml`.

---

## 1. The three repos at a glance

| Repo | Local path | Remote | Role in pipeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| nixos-config | `~/src/config` | `git@github.com:JulianKragt/nixos-config.git` | Source of host definitions, bootstrap configs, `hostSpec`, users. Rebuilt in Phase 3. |
| nix-secrets | `~/src/nix-secrets` | `git@github.com:JulianKragt/nix-secrets.git` (private) | `.sops.yaml` recipients + encrypted YAML. Written in Phase 2. |
| installer | `~/src/installer` | `git@github.com:JulianKragt/nixos-installer.git` | Go module `installer`, Go 1.27. Replaces `config/scripts/install-host.sh`. |

`~/src/reference/` holds two third-party configs (EmergentMind, vimjoyer) used as inspiration only.

**Predecessor:** `config/scripts/install-host.sh` (+ `just install|enroll-sops|deploy-remote`) already implements an older version of this flow in bash. It is the best spec for the "how"; the Pipeline doc is the spec for the "what". Note: `config` has *staged, uncommitted* changes to `install-host.sh`, `provision-spec.nix`, `secrets.nix`, `README.md`.

---

## Users — one way to add or remove

The users on a host are the files `home/<u>/<host>.nix` (`usersForHost` in `config/lib/helpers.nix` → `accounts.activeUsers`). Per-user policy lives in `accounts.users.<u>` (full config; today only `secrets`, default true). Install behaviour (hardware generation, SOPS enrollment, deploy, timeouts) is installer flags, not Nix.

- **Add**: create `home/<u>/<host>.nix` (+ `accounts/<u>/keys` if new to the repo), commit. **Delete**: remove the file, commit.
- **Apply**: `installer secrets --host <h> --target <ip>`. First install runs the same reconcile as later changes.
- **Reconcile** = `accounts.users` (read with `nix eval --json .#nixosConfigurations.<h>.config.accounts.users`) vs. state and `host-users/*`: add recipient + author `host-users/<h>-<u>.yaml` + commit/push for new users; prune file and recipient for removed users; then rebuild. The secret file must exist before the rebuild (`mutableUsers = false`).
- Not supported: `useradd`/`userdel` on the box; hand-editing recipients to add a user.
- Kinds: primary admin and additional human users (password + keys + Home Manager), shared login account (`media`, sops password), service users (`isSystemUser`, from service modules, invisible to the installer), operator/root key lists (`accounts/super/keys`, not accounts).

---

## 2. nixos-config — what the installer reads

### Flake shape
- flake-parts "dendritic" layout; every fragment is listed explicitly in `imports.nix` (new host files must be added there).
- Each NixOS host exposes **two** outputs:
  - `nixosConfigurations.<host>-bootstrap` → `hosts/nixos/<host>/bootstrap.nix` (minimal: bootstrap-base + host-<h>-spec + openssh + disko + hardware-config)
  - `nixosConfigurations.<host>` → full system (host-spec, core/sops, users, home-manager…)
- Host is a valid install target iff `hosts/nixos/<host>/bootstrap.nix` exists.
- Hosts today: `atlas` (NixOS workstation, `/dev/nvme0n1`, already installed once), `broadway` (NixOS server, disk still `REPLACE_ME`, users jkragt + media), `workhorse` (darwin), `wsl`.

### Host discovery (modules/bootstrap-base.nix)
`provisionSpec` was removed. `nix eval --json .#installHosts` returns, per host, `{ hostSpec, disk, users }`; `hostSpec` is the same option set as the full config (`hostName`, `primaryUser`, `role`, `timeZone`, `stateVersion`, …). The former install-policy options now live in the installer:

| Former option | Now |
|---|---|
| `generateHardware`, `hardwareConfigPath` | flag / file-exists check; path is `hosts/nixos/<host>/hardware-configuration.nix` |
| `luksPasswordFile` | fixed `/tmp/disko-password` (matches `disko.nix`) |
| `enrollSops`, `pushSecrets`, `deployFullConfig`, `sshWaitTimeout`, `nixosAnywhereExtra`, `nixSecretsPath` | installer flags with defaults |
| `provisionUserAgeKey` | dropped (obsolete, see §6.2) |

The bootstrap config also sets systemd-boot and root SSH keys. It does **not** currently include git / sops / age / ssh-to-age / vim (required by Pipeline Stage 0.1 and 1.2).

### Other useful evaluations
- Disk: `nix eval --raw .#nixosConfigurations.<host>-bootstrap.config.disko.devices.disk.main.device` — fail if it contains `REPLACE_ME`.
- Users on a host: a user lives on host iff `home/<user>/<host>.nix` exists. Authoritative: `nix eval --json .#nixosConfigurations.<host>.config.accounts.activeUsers`.
- Primary user: `hostSpec.primaryUser` (full config) / same option on the bootstrap config.

### Disk / boot facts that affect the flow
- Disko layout: GPT, 1G ESP, **LUKS** (`cryptroot`) → btrfs subvolumes `@root @home @nix @swap`. Passphrase file `/tmp/disko-password` must exist on the ISO before nixos-anywhere runs.
- No initrd SSH unlock → after reboot (Stage 0.2) someone must type the LUKS passphrase at the console before SSH comes up. The SSH wait timeout covers this.
- Before install the target is a NixOS ISO; legacy flow asks the operator to run `sudo passwd` so root SSH works.

### SSH / host identity
- openssh: ed25519 only, `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key`, `PermitRootLogin = prohibit-password`, no password auth. NixOS generates the host key on first boot → Stage 1.1 mostly *reads* it.
- Legacy flow: TOFU while waiting, then `ssh-keyscan -t ed25519` pins the key into a temp known_hosts with `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`.

### How the full config consumes secrets (current state)
- Host (NixOS sops-nix, `hosts/common/core/sops.nix`): `defaultSopsFile = ${nix-secrets}/hosts/<host>.yaml`; identity = host SSH key (`age.sshKeyPaths`) + `/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt`; `validateSopsFiles = false`.
- User passwords (`hosts/common/accounts/secrets.nix`): `sops.secrets."passwords/<u>"` from **`users/<u>.yaml`** key `hashedPassword`, `neededForUsers = true` → `users.users.<u>.hashedPasswordFile`. `users.mutableUsers = false`, so a missing/undecryptable password = no console login.
- Home Manager (`home/common/core/sops.nix`): `defaultSopsFile = users/<u>.yaml`, identity `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`, renders `ssh/private_key` → `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `ssh/public_key` → `.pub`.
- Activation script `sopsUserAgeKeys` moves `/var/lib/sops-nix/pending-user-age-keys/<u>` into `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`.
- Flake input: `nix-secrets = git+ssh://git@github.com/JulianKragt/nix-secrets.git?ref=main&shallow=1`, `flake = false`. Currently locked at rev `5b3f9e7`.

## 3. nix-secrets — current layout and state

```
.sops.yaml          keys + creation_rules
shared.yaml         cross-host (only user_jkragt can decrypt)
hosts/<host>.yaml   atlas (encrypted to host_atlas), workhorse (0 bytes!)
users/<user>.yaml   jkragt: ssh.public_key, ssh.private_key, hashedPassword
templates/host.yaml placeholder: change_me
templates/user.yaml hashedPassword, id_ed25519
justfile            edit, edit-user, edit-host, rekey, user-recipient, host-recipient, user-identity, host-identity
flake.nix           devShell: age, sops, ssh-to-age, mkpasswd, just
```

`.sops.yaml` today: anchors `&host_atlas`, `&user_jkragt`, `&host_workhorse`; rules for `shared.yaml`, `hosts/workhorse.yaml`, `users/jkragt.yaml`, and `hosts/atlas\.yaml$` **twice**.

Problems found. Julian is fixing them in the migration to pipeline paths; they are kept here because the installer must not reintroduce them:
- **Duplicate atlas rule**: the bash script checks `grep "hosts/atlas.yaml"` but writes the escaped regex `hosts/atlas\.yaml$`, so the check never matches and every re-run appends. The Go version must edit `.sops.yaml` structurally (e.g. `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` Node API, which preserves anchors, aliases and comments) instead of grepping.
- sops uses the **first matching** creation rule — insert specific host/user rules before any catch-all and dedupe by `path_regex`.
- `hosts/workhorse.yaml` is empty; `hosts/atlas.yaml` has the template comments encrypted (`#ENC[...]`) — strip comments when materializing templates.
- `templates/user.yaml` (`id_ed25519`) does not match what config reads (`ssh/private_key`, `ssh/public_key`, `hashedPassword`). Templates are effectively the schema for Stage 2.3 validation, so they need to agree with config.
- Git history is full of repeated `feat(atlas): add age recipient` / `chore: update nix-secrets flake lock` commits — a symptom of non-idempotent re-runs that Stage 4.2 should fix.

---

## 4. Installer (Go) — current state

```
cmd/nixos-installer/     main.go    signals, log file, runner, wiring
                         flags.go   --target --host --config --disk --verbose
                         inputs.go  asks for what the flags left empty, loads the host's state
cmd/logdemo/             shows the look of the runner (dev only)
internal/runner/         live task tree, log file, questions to the operator; see docs/RUNNER.md
internal/pipeline/       the engine every stage uses
                         pipeline.go  Inputs, Env, Stage, Run (resume loop)
                         machine.go   Machine: run a command here or on the target over ssh
                         state.go     State, LoadState, Save
internal/stages/         one file per stage, plus the tool helpers they share
                         stages.go    All: the ordered stage list
                         00_environment_preparation.go
                         disk.go      lsblk parsing, disk choice
```

How a run goes: `main` parses the flags into `pipeline.Inputs`, `resolveInputs` asks for the missing target and host and loads `<state dir>/<host>.json`, then `pipeline.Run(ctx, env, stages.All)` runs the stages in list order. A stage whose ID is in `State.Completed` is skipped; every other stage is recorded and the state saved when it succeeds. A stage with `Always: true` (0.0) runs every time and is never recorded.

Three kinds of data, kept apart:

- `pipeline.Inputs`: what the operator chose for this run (flags and answers). Never persisted.
- `pipeline.State`: facts that must survive a restart (install disk, completed stages, later recipients and commits). One JSON file per host.
- `pipeline.Machine`: where commands run. `env.Local` is the provider, `env.Remote` the target (`ssh … -l root <target>` with the system ssh).

### Adding a stage

1. `internal/stages/<nn>_<name>.go` with `func <name>(ctx context.Context, env *pipeline.Env) error`. Sub-steps are `runner.Run` / `runner.Parallel`; commands are `env.Local.Run(ctx, "nix", …)` and `env.Remote.Run(ctx, "lsblk", …)`; secrets go through `RunStdin`, never through args.
2. One entry in `stages.All`, at its place in the order.
3. A fact a later run needs becomes a field on `pipeline.State`. A new flag becomes a field on `pipeline.Inputs` and a line in `flags.go`.
4. A tool several stages call (`nix eval`, `git`, `sops`) becomes a plain file in `internal/stages` taking a `pipeline.Machine`, like `disk.go`.

### Conventions

- No interface without two implementations, no package without a second importer in sight.
- Stages are plain functions; everything they need comes in through `ctx` and `*pipeline.Env`.
- State holds only what must survive a restart.

## 5. Legacy bash → Pipeline mapping

| Pipeline stage | Runs on | Legacy `install-host.sh` equivalent | Port notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0 Environment preparation | provider (+target `lsblk`) | `eval_spec`, arg parsing, tool/disk resolution | Always runs (not recorded in `State.Completed`). Checks target reachable on :22, `ssh root@target true`, `nix ssh git` in PATH, internet, config flake; disk from `--disk`, else the non-removable whole disks on the target: the one recorded by an earlier run, a lone disk, or the operator's pick from a numbered list. |
| 0.1 Provider preparation | provider | `eval_spec`, preflight: nix-secrets present, disk not `REPLACE_ME`, ping, `ssh root@ip`, remote `nix`/`lsblk`/internet check, `test -b $DEVICE`, show `lsblk`, type "install", LUKS prompt → `/tmp/disko-password` | Keep the typed confirmation + lsblk display. Stream the LUKS pass via stdin, never argv. Use a TCP dial instead of ping. |
| 0.2 Base install | provider → target | `nix run github:nix-community/nixos-anywhere -- [--generate-hardware-config …] --build-on-remote --flake .#<host>-bootstrap --target-host root@ip`; commit hardware config; skip if `/run/current-system` exists | Then wait for SSH (`sshWaitTimeout`, poll 5s), TOFU then pin ed25519 host key → state. |
| 1.1 Host identity | target | `cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub \| ssh-to-age` (run on provider) | Can be done in Go with `github.com/Mic92/ssh-to-age` (library) — no tool needed. Store recipient + fingerprint in state. |
| 1.2 Readiness | target | partial (internet ping) | Add `git ls-remote`-style GitHub reachability + `git sops vim nix` presence. Marker `awaiting-secrets-phase`. |
| 2.0 Auth bootstrap | target | — (relied on operator's SSH agent on provider) | New. See §6.3. |
| 2.1 Sync repo | target | — (used local `../nix-secrets`) | New: clone/fetch/reset on target. |
| 2.2 Recipients / .sops.yaml | target | python insert of `&host_<h>` + append rule; conflict check when anchor exists with another key | Structural YAML edit, idempotent, also host-users rules. |
| 2.3 Template authoring | target | `cp templates/host.yaml` + `sops --encrypt --in-place` | New: per-user templates, interactive vim over `ssh -t`, schema validation. |
| 2.4 Encrypt/commit/push | target | `sops updatekeys -y hosts/<h>.yaml shared.yaml`, `git add -A; commit; push` | Commit only the listed paths (not `-A`). Verify `sops:` metadata in every secret file. Persist SHA. |
| 3.1 Flake input | provider or target | `nix flake update nix-secrets` + commit `flake.lock` (in config, on provider) | See §6.4. |
| 3.2 Rebuild | target | `nixos-rebuild --flake .#<h> --target-host root@ip --build-host root@ip switch` (from provider) | Pipeline wants it on target. Validation list from legacy Phase 9 is reusable. |
| 3.3 Cleanup | target | `trap rm KNOWN_HOSTS` only | New: wipe temp creds, optional upstream revoke, marker `converged`. |
| 4.1 Policy | provider/target | — | New: no plaintext, rule coverage for every `hosts/*`/`host-users/*`. |
| 4.2 Recovery | — | `--enroll-sops`, `--deploy-remote` modes | Becomes "resume from persisted state". |

Legacy Phase 9 validation checks worth keeping: `systemctl --failed`, `sops-nix` active, `/run/secrets-for-users/passwords/<u>` readable, `~<u>/.ssh/id_ed25519` mode 600, `home-manager-<u>.service` not failed, `nixos-version`.

---

## 6. Gaps between the Pipeline and the current repos (decisions needed)

### 6.1 Secret path model changes — DECIDED: migrate to pipeline paths
Pipeline canonical paths are `hosts/<host>.yaml` and `host-users/<host>-<user>.yaml`. nix-secrets is being migrated to them. Config still reads `users/<user>.yaml` (shared across hosts), so `hosts/common/accounts/secrets.nix` and `home/common/core/sops.nix` in config have to follow, and `users/jkragt.yaml` moves to `host-users/<host>-jkragt.yaml` for each host. The templates (`templates/host.yaml`, `templates/user.yaml`) should match the keys config reads, because the installer uses them as the schema in Stage 2.3.

### 6.2 Who decrypts `host-users/*` — and the operator key
Today `users/<u>.yaml` is encrypted only to `&user_<u>`, so the legacy flow **copies the operator's age identity onto every device** (README calls this out as a security consequence). With per-host-user files:
- Recipients = `&host_<host>` (so the target can decrypt unattended) + `&user_<u>` / operator (so you can edit from your laptop).
- Then the target needs no copy of the operator key: user secrets can be decrypted by system sops-nix with `owner = <u>` and a path in the home dir, instead of Home Manager sops with `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`. That makes `provisionUserAgeKey`, the pending-key activation script and Phase 7.5 of the bash script obsolete.
- Decision: adopt this (recommended — it is what the Pipeline implies) or keep HM-sops with a delivered key.

### 6.3 Git auth on the target vs. the `git+ssh` flake input
- `nix-secrets` is fetched by Nix as `git+ssh://`. A GitHub App token or fine-grained PAT is HTTPS-only, so Phase 3 evaluation on the target would not use it unless the URL is rewritten (`--override-input nix-secrets git+https://…` or git `insteadOf` in a temp `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`) — whether Nix's git fetcher honours `insteadOf` in your Nix version needs verifying.
- A **deploy key** (SSH, write access) fits the existing URL directly via a temp `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` / ssh config, but deploy keys are per-repo. If the target also has to clone/push `nixos-config` (private? Stage 3.1), it needs a second key — or use a GitHub App token covering both repos.
- Alternative that avoids target write-access to config entirely: see 6.4.

### 6.4 Where the flake.lock update happens
Committing `flake.lock` on the target needs push access to `nixos-config` too. Options:
1. Target: `nixos-rebuild switch --flake <config>#<host> --override-input nix-secrets 'git+ssh://…?ref=main&rev=<SHA>'` (no lock commit on target), and the provider runs `nix flake update nix-secrets` + commit + push afterwards.
2. Provider updates and pushes the lock after Stage 2.4, target pulls config at that commit.
3. Target does it all (needs auth for both repos).

### 6.5 Recipients for users
"Ensure user recipient entries exist for all host users" — source of truth is undecided. Existing options: the `&user_<u>` anchors in `.sops.yaml` (only `jkragt` exists), or derive with ssh-to-age from `config/hosts/common/accounts/<u>/keys/*.pub` (jkragt has `workhorse.pub` + a `PLACEHOLDER.pub`; `media` has no keys dir). `broadway` would fail today because `media` has no recipient. Fail-closed with a clear message is the safe default.

### 6.6 Re-install = new host key
A reinstall generates a new host key, so `&host_<host>` changes and the old `hosts/<host>.yaml` can no longer be decrypted on the target. The bash script dies ("remove manually"). The Go installer needs a policy: replace the anchor and re-author from template on the target, or have the operator rekey from the provider (who holds a user key that is also a recipient). Alternative: pre-generate the host key on the provider and inject it with `nixos-anywhere --extra-files` so the recipient is known (and stable) before install.

### 6.7 Editing on the target
- Encrypting needs only public recipients — fine on the target.
- Re-editing an already-encrypted host or host-user file on the target needs a private key: the host SSH key works if the host is a recipient (sops supports SSH keys for age decryption via `SOPS_AGE_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` in recent versions — verify against the sops version in nixpkgs).
- `shared.yaml` is encrypted to the user only, so the target can **not** `updatekeys` it (the bash script did, from the provider). Either keep shared-secret rekeying as a provider-side step or drop it from the target flow.

### 6.8 Bootstrap config additions
Add to the bootstrap module : `git`, `sops`, `age`, `ssh-to-age`, `vim`, and whatever runtime the installer needs on the target (if the Go binary itself runs there, either `nix run` it from a flake or `scp` a static `GOOS=linux` build).

### 6.9 Housekeeping spotted
- `hosts/nixos/atlas/default.nix` sets `users.users.root.initialPassword = "test"` in the full config — remove.
- `broadway/disko.nix` device is still `REPLACE_ME`.

---

## 7. Direction for the Go code

- **State**: `pipeline.State`, JSON per host in `~/.local/state/nixos-installer/<host>.json`, saved after every stage. Has `Host`, `Disk`, `Completed`. To add as stages need them: `Users []string`, `PrimaryUser`, `HostKeyFingerprint`, `HostRecipient`, `UserRecipients map[string]string`, `SecretsCommit`, `ConfigRev`, `Marker` (`awaiting-secrets-phase`, `converged`).
- **Stage IDs**: strings matching the Pipeline (`"0.1"`, `"2.3"`…); the order is the order of `stages.All`; resume = skip what is in `State.Completed`.
- **Machines**: `pipeline.Machine` runs a command locally or through the system `ssh`, with output streamed to the runner and stdin for secrets (`RunStdin`). Still to add with the stage that needs it: an opt-out from streaming for commands that print secrets, and an interactive mode (`ssh -t`, attach the terminal, stop the spinner first) for vim.
- **Host key**: `pipeline.SSH` still disables host key checking (TODO in `machine.go`). Stage 0.2 should pin the key (TOFU into a known_hosts file under the state dir) by extending that option list, and pass the same options to nixos-anywhere / nixos-rebuild so there is one SSH configuration.
- **Tool helpers** to add in `internal/stages`: `nix eval --json`, `nixos-anywhere`, `ssh-keyscan`, `git`, `sops`, `nixos-rebuild`. Do ssh→age conversion and `.sops.yaml` editing in-process.
- **CLI** (`cmd/nixos-installer/flags.go`, `inputs.go`): `--target` (prompted when empty; IPv4, IPv6, or link-local IPv6 with zone such as `fe80::1%eth0`), `--host` (picked from `hosts/nixos/*/bootstrap.nix` when empty), `--config` (default `./`), `--disk` (picked on the target when empty), `--verbose`. Planned: `install --host --target` (full) and `secrets --host --target` (Phase 2–3 resume, as in Pipeline 4.2, by filtering `stages.All`); `--state-dir`.
- **Secrets hygiene**: never put secrets in argv or logs (bash script already follows this — keep it), always `umask 077` on target, cleanup in a deferred step even on failure.
